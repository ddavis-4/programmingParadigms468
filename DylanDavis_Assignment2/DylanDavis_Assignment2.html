	<body><!__in my research for this project I found that It helps to keep code in divisions in HTML so for the body all of my exercises are in their own divisions.__>

		<div style="text-align: center;"><!__Here we center the whole division, as center tags obsolete__>
			<h1>EECS 468 Assignment 2 </h1> <!__ Title for the page in HTML __>
			<h4>Dylan Davis | 3047302</h4><!__Author__>
			<br><!__space to make page look better __>
		</div>
		<!__this division is just html and the titles for the page, no exersises.__>

		<!__This is the division for Exercise 2.1, once again centered in the div tag. I used buttons to call my JS functions, so when clicking the buttion named 'looping a triangle' it calls the function 'loopinT()' which I will explain later __>	
		<div style="text-align: center;">
			<h2>Exercise 2.1: The Looping Triangle</h2>
			<h4>Press for Looping Triangle: </h4>
			<button onclick = "loopinT()">Looping a Triangle</button></br>
			<br>
		</div>
		<div id = "THETRIANGLE"> </div> <!__ this is the id value that the function will replace with the looped triangle after it has run. It is not inside the division because then it would be centered, and in the example it was not centered.__>

		<!__This is the division for 2.2 fizz buzz, like before when pressing the button the JS function 'fizzbuzz()' is called. __>
		<div style="text-align: center;"> 
			<h2>Exercise 2.2: FizzBuzz</h2>
			<h4>Press for FizzBuzz:</h4>
			<button onclick = "fizzbuzz()">Generate</button></br>
			<br>
			<h5>Start:</h5><!__cosmetic __>
			<div id = "hundo"> </div><!__This is the id value that will be replaced with the list of values created by the function __>
			<h5>End</h5> <!__ cosmetic__>
		</div>

		<!__This is the division for 2.3, slightly different from before now we have 2 buttons each calling a different function, but those respective functions call another function that generates a grid based on a size parameter.__>
		<div style="text-align: center;"> 
			<h2>Exercise 2.3: n-by-n Grid</h2>
			<h4>Size = 8:</h4>
			<button onclick = "ateGrid()">N-by-N Grid</button></br>
			<br>
			<div id = 'eightGrid'> </div><!__value to be replaced when button is pressed__>
			<br>
			<h4>Size = 14:</h4>
			<button onclick = "forteenGrid()">N-by-N Grid</button></br>
			<br>
			<div id = 'fourteenGrid'> </div><!__value to be replaced when button is pressed__>
